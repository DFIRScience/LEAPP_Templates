## LEAPP Templates

### How to use

Artifacts parsing scripts can be found in the the scripts->artifacts folder of LEAPP tools.

General procedure for creating a new artifact (module) is:

1. Copy this template into the scripts -> artifacts folder.
2. Rename the template to the artifact name. No duplicates allowed.
3. Edit scripts -> ilap_artifacts.py, and add your artfiact information and target files.
4. Edit the new template file to include your artifact parser and adjust reporting.
